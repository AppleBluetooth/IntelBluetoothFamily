# IntelBluetoothFamily
Kexts enabling native support for Intel Bluetooth chipsets in macOS.

Most of the code is complete, and I am now in the testing phase! I would try to make the kext load ASAP and make sure it does not cause kernel panics. I will post the first release after that for public testing and from there go step by step.
